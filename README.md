#### Idea behind the project:

* This project was made by measuring the need of some shopkeepers near my hometown who were facing difficulty in managing and counting the products in their respective shops.
* They all were entangled within the old framework of Writing down the product counts in a notebook which was at risk of keeping it very carefully.
* Thus this project basically keeps the products record in the app and it thus makes it easier for the user as well as the shopkeeper to check the updates about the stock in the shop.
* This app provided an efficient way to keep records and personalize their grocery app such as to make them available for the customers to check out the availability of the product.
